## Overview 

This folder contains a bunch of scripts and other small tweaks that make certain commonly done processes in Finals Unit faster. For example, the first one I made skips several mouse clicks necessary when printing a page to PDF from ECMS and allows the user to skip straight from looking at the page to the print dialog. 

Each folder holds all the information for a single tweak, and contains another README.md to explain how to install and use the tweak or tool.

## Tweaks Summary

**PrintECMSPage:** A chrome bookmarklet that, when used on an ECMS page for a project summary, work order, work order explanation, or work order authorization, automatically takes you to a print dialog with the correctly formatted version of that page, then closes that window after you hit print. 

This removes many steps, namely the steps of hitting the printer button (which formats the page correctly), the Control-P press necessary to open the print dialog, and the mouse movement necessary to hit the X button after printing. So, in short, it removes 3-4 keypresses, heavily reduces the mental load required, and speeds up the entire process.
